## Summary
The patient is a 67-year-old former smoker presenting with a persistent cough. While the patient's medical history and lab results do not indicate any obvious underlying cause, the persistent cough could potentially be related to lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Given the patient's history of smoking, it would be important to evaluate the possibility of NSCLC and test for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, which can guide targeted treatment options. [1,2,3,4]

## Insights
- EGFR mutation testing is recommended for selecting patients with non-squamous NSCLC for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. [1,2,3,4]
- Timely and accurate EGFR mutation testing is necessary to optimize treatment decisions for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, there is a lack of standardized processes to ensure consistent EGFR testing implementation. [3,4]
- Potential next steps may include:
  - Obtaining a tissue biopsy or liquid biopsy to test for EGFR mutations [2]
  - Considering imaging tests (e.g., CT scan) to evaluate for potential lung cancer [1,2]
  - Monitoring the patient's cough and overall clinical status closely [1,2]
- The patient's history of smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, but the persistent cough could also be due to other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. [1,2]
